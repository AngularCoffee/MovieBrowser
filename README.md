# MovieBrowser
an AngularJs project to show The Terminator Collection info

To run this project:

# go to app folder, run bower install
# place your themoviedb API key in home.js 
    var apiKey = 'your_API_key';
# If you don't have an API key, you will need to sign-up for the API key: https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup.


Assumptions:
# The Movie Credits section only displays the cast members, not Producers, etc.
# The images and thumbnails for movie poster and cast member profile use the same image with different sizes.

Notes:
* A few unit tests have been added, more to come.
