# MovieBrowser
an AngularJs project to show The Terminator Collection info

To run this project:

1. go to app folder, run bower install
2. place your themoviedb API key in home.js 
    var apiKey = 'Place your API Key here';
3. If you don't have an API key, you will need to sign-up for the API key: https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup.


Assumptions:
1. The Movie Credits section only displays the cast members, not Producers, etc.
2. The images and thumbnails for movie poster and cast member profile use the same image with different sizes.

Notes:
A few unit tests have been added, more to come.
